## Configuration


-   Edit the  [`configuration/environment.js`](https://github.com/WeAreAthlon/frontend-webpack-boilerplate/blob/master/configuration/environment.js)  if you want to specify:
    -   **`server`**: configure development server, specify  `host`,  `port`. Refer to the full development server configuration options for  [`webpack-dev-server`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/).
    -   **`limits`**: configure file size thresholds for assets optimizations.
        -   Image/Font files size in bytes. Below this value the image file will be served as Data URL (_inline base64_).
    -   **`paths`**:  `src`  or  `dist`  directories names and file system location.

## Additional  `webpack`  configuration

You can additionally configure  `webpack`  for specific environment:

-   `development`  -  [`configuration/webpack.dev.config.js`](https://github.com/WeAreAthlon/frontend-webpack-boilerplate/blob/master/configuration/webpack.dev.config.js)
-   `production`  -  [`configuration/webpack.prod.config.js`](https://github.com/WeAreAthlon/frontend-webpack-boilerplate/blob/master/configuration/webpack.prod.config.js)
    -   Note that if you prefer to build and deploy  [`sourcemap`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/devtool/#production)  files:

> You should configure your server to disallow access to the Source Map file for normal users!
